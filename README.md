# Shimmering Focus

**Basic features**
- minimalistic: removes as much stuff as possible
  -  similar to the [hider plugin](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-hider), with the exception 
  -  use `cmd + ,` to access the settings without ribbons
  -  use the [Filename-Heading-Sync Plugin](https://github.com/dvcrn/obsidian-filename-heading-sync) to automatically rename files without the need for a titlebar.
  -  to change view, set a hotkey for `toggle edit/preview mode` command
- functionalistic: relationship lines in lists & file explorer, icons to indicate folder and file types, wrapping in the file explorer
- suited for academic writing: [Pandoc citations](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations-in-note-styles) and footnotes are visually emphasized, and the alt-text of images is used as caption as done in Pandoc
- condensed: uses screen real estate more efficiently to display more information. Useful for smaller screens.
- accessible: increased contrast, especially with [those "gray on light-gray" cases](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/enhance-default-color-contrast-of-the-icons/23045/3)
- redable: includes "bug fixes", like making the [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) code more readable
- otherwise, the theme pretty much follows Obsidian's default theme, with [iA Writer Quattro](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts/tree/master/iA%20Writer%20Quattro) and some shimmering green as secondary accent
