## Features & Design Principles
**minimalistic**
- removes as much clutter as possible, similar to the [hider plugin](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-hider) (with the exception of the scrollbar in th editor)
- intended for use for keyboard shortcuts and the command palette. (access the settings via `cmd + ,`)
- tip: [Filename-Heading-Sync Plugin](https://github.com/dvcrn/obsidian-filename-heading-sync) can be used to remove the need for renaming notes (and therefore removes the need for the header bar)

**light & dark**
- designed for light mode & dark mode

**functionalistic**
- relationship lines in lists & file explorer
- active line highlighting
- Material Icons to indicate folder and file types, wrapping in the file explorer

**suited for academic writing**
- [Pandoc citations](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations-in-note-styles) and footnotes are visually emphasized
- [the alt-text of images is used as caption text](https://gist.github.com/chrisgrieser/4f64b0fc656480ea707d2b45a03acdc0), in line with Pandoc's conversion behavior

**condensed**
- uses screen real estate more efficiently to display more information
- useful for smaller screens

**accessible**
- increased contrast throughout, especially with the [annoying grey font on light-grey background](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/enhance-default-color-contrast-of-the-icons/23045/3)
- make [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) code more readable
- minor coloring of bold in dark mode to make it more readable, since bold in dark mode is harder to distinguish form normal text than  in light mode

**subtle design**  
- apart from the points mentioned, the theme pretty much follows Obsidian's default theme, with [iA Writer Quattro](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts/tree/master/iA%20Writer%20Quattro) as main font and some shimmering green as secondary accent

## Installation
