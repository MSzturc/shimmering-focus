## Design Principles

### Extreme Minimalism
- This theme is mainly intended for experienced users using mainly the keyboard for navigation.
- As much clutter as possible is removed, letting you focus on content & information that matters.
- You can re-enable all hidden elements by using the [Style Settings Plugin](#Customization).
- üí° The settings can still be accessed via `cmd + ,` or `ctrl + ,`.

### Condensed Information Display
- Uses screen real estate more efficiently to display more information.
- Useful for smaller screens, Split Screens, bigger font sizes or simply if want to see more information without having to scroll.
- Smaller images/PDFs. Click-and-Hold or use the [Max View Feature](#Max-View) to enlarge them again.
- Wider input boxes

### Maximum Readability
- increased contrast throughout, especially with the [annoying grey font on light grey background](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/enhance-default-color-contrast-of-the-icons/23045/3)
- decreased font size variation to increase readability & information density
- at the same time increased distinctiveness of different classes through subtle variation in typeface, font style, or backgrounds
- alternating row colors in tables, Command Palette, and Quick Switchers
- easy-to-read fonts for every use case
  - [iA Writer Quattro](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts/tree/master/iA%20Writer%20Quattro) for regular text.
  - [Input Mono](https://input.djr.com/) as monospace font for code
  - [Optima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optima) as humanist heading font
  - [Crimson Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Pro) as serif font for Longform projects
- minor coloring of bold in dark mode to make it more readable, since bold in dark mode is harder to distinguish form normal text than  in light mode
- slightly thicker lines (icons, hr, tables, etc.)

### Subtle Design
Stylistically, the theme pretty much follows Obsidian's default theme, with mostly subtle changes ‚Äì like the eponymous shimmering green as secondary accent.

## Customization
