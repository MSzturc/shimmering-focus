A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

**Is the Problem related to Obsidian 0.13+ / Live Preview Mode?**
It is extremely helpful to know whether the issue occurred due to Obsidian's new Live Preview feature introduced in version 0.13+. To test this, go the the Obsidian settings and turn on `Use Legacy Editor`. Please report here whether the bug you are encountering still occurs or does not occur anymore when using the Legacy Editor. 

If the bug seems to be related to Live Preview, please report it in [this thread](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-focus/issues/61), so I can prioritize bugs related to Live Preview (once publicly released).

**Relevant Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Checklist**
- [ ] I have updated to the latest version of the theme (`Obsidian Settings → Appearance → Themes - Manage → Update`).
- [ ] I checked that the issue does not occur when using the default theme.
