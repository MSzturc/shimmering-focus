**Is the Problem related to Obsidian 0.13+ / Live Preview Mode?**

To test this, go the the Obsidian settings and turn on `Use Legacy Editor`.

**Checklist**
- [ ] I have updated to the latest version of the theme (`Obsidian Settings → Appearance → Themes - Manage → Update`).

- [ ] In case I am missing an UI element, I have checked that it cannot be re-enabled with the [Style Settings plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings).
